This repository hosts the code and data for [**On-land pinniped classification of multiple species and demographic classes on multiple substrates using deep learning and aerial imagery**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/aqc.70111).

To get started, I'd check out the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to learn about the environment of this project. Then I'd look at model training and inference inside of the Jupyter notebooks in [Data/elephant-seals](./Data/elephant-seals) and [Data/harbor-seals](./Data/harbor-seals).
